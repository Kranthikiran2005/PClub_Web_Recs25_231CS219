# 📸 NITK Photography Club Website

#Task-2

A simple, interactive photo gallery website for the NITK Photography Club. Users can browse beautiful photo cards, filter them by category, like their favorite shots, and shuffle the gallery layout.

🎞️ **Dynamic Photo Cards**  
  Photos are loaded dynamically using JavaScript from a predefined product list.

- 🔍 **Category Filtering**  
  View specific types of photos by selecting categories like:
  - Nature
  - Portrait
  - College
  - Beach

- ❤️ **Like Functionality**  
  Click on the back of any photo card to increment a like count. Like count is stored in `localStorage` and persists across page refreshes (shared across all cards for now).

- 🔀 **Shuffle Gallery**  
  A shuffle button allows users to randomly reorder the displayed photo cards.

- 🔁 **Flip Card Animation**  
  Hovering over a photo flips the card to reveal the caption and like count, using 3D CSS animations.

- 🌐 **Responsive Grid Layout**  
  The layout uses CSS Grid for clean structure — a sidebar for filters and a main section for images.
